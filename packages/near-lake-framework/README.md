# NEAR Lake Framework

NEAR Lake Framework is a syntactical framework for accessing the NEAR Lake Indexer Data. It is a wrapper around the AWS API.

Has `@near-lake/primitives` as a dependency, which contains the types for the data with associated helper functions.

## Simple Example

```ts
import { startStream, types } from '@near-lake/framework';

const lakeConfig: types.LakeConfig = {
    s3BucketName: 'near-lake-data-mainnet',
    s3RegionName: 'eu-central-1',
    startBlockHeight: 66264389,
};

async function handleBlock(
    block: types.Block,
    context: types.LakeContext
): Promise<void> {
    // custom logic for handling the block
    let events = block.eventsByAccountId("x.paras.near")
    console.log(events)
}

(async () => {
    await startStream(lakeConfig, handleStreamerMessage);
})();
```
The main function in this example is `handleBlock(block, context)`, which contains custom logic for how to handle a given block. `block` is of type `Block` from `@near-lake/primitives` which gives access to helper methods to make it easier to extract data. You may find a list of helper functions [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@near-lake/primitives).
